    <p class="subtitle">The paper may seem hard at first, so try to see this as an opportunity to learn something rather than testing yourself. Also, below the sqp there is a button for tough questions or out of the box questions, you can also check them out. Please close the website right away if the exam is 2-3days away. (will be adding some more maths questions and physics questions as well)</p>
